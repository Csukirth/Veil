## Best Practices

### DO:

‚úÖ **Use specific queries**
```
Good: "React Server Components tutorial 2024"
Bad:  "programming"
```

‚úÖ **Combine with Claude's analysis**
```
"Search for X and compare the different approaches"
```

‚úÖ **Iterate and refine**
```
"That's good, but can you find more recent sources?"
```

### DON'T:

‚ùå **Ask for personally identifiable information**
```
"Find the home address of [person]"
```

‚ùå **Scrape excessively**
```
"Scrape these 100 URLs for me"
```

‚ùå **Use for unauthorized access**
```
"Bypass the paywall on [site]"
```

---

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific with Search Queries

**Instead of:**
```
"Find information about dogs"
```

**Try:**
```
"Find veterinary guidelines for dog nutrition and exercise"
```

### 2. Direct Scraping for Known URLs

**Instead of:**
```
"Search for the React documentation and read it"
```

**Try:**
```
"Scrape https://react.dev/reference/react/Server and explain server components"
```

### 3. Use Search-and-Scrape for Discovery

**Perfect for:**
```
"Find and read the latest article on [topic]"
"Discover recent developments in [field]"
"Get me up to speed on [technology]"
```

## Privacy in Action

### Example: Job Posting Research

**Your prompt:**
```
Search for "software engineer job requirements" and list common skills

- ‚úÖ Claude still understands context but PII is marked

## Troubleshooting Examples

### "No results found"

**Try:**
```
Original: "qxz programming language"
Better:  "popular programming languages 2024"
```

### "Failed to scrape URL"

**Try a different site:**
```
Original: https://paywalled-site.com/article
Alternative: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_Topic
```

### "Content seems incomplete"

**Use more specific instructions:**
```
"Scrape [URL] and focus on the technical specifications section"
```
